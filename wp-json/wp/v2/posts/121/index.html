So it is with a great deal of excitement that I&#8217;ve been finding my self reading and rereading half a year old spoilers i.e. language road\u00a0blogs for C# 7.0.<\/p>\n<p>https:\/\/blogs.msdn.microsoft.com\/dotnet\/2016\/08\/24\/whats-new-in-csharp-7-0\/<\/p>\n<p>Tuples in particular are practically making me squeal with glee. Here&#8217;s the basic form:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: csharp; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\npublic (string fullName, int id, bool isFaculty) GetRegistrant(string&#x5B;] email)\r\n{\r\n  \/\/Retrieve registrant info into local variables  \r\n  return (fullName: fN, id: i, isFaculty: iF)\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic static void Main()\r\n{\r\n    var registrant = GetRegistrant(&quot;test@example.com);\r\n    Console.WriteLine($&quot;Hello {registrant.fullName}!&quot;);\r\n    var (name, number, occupation) = GetRegistrant(&quot;another@example.com&quot;;\r\n    Console.WriteLine($&quot;Your ID is {number}&quot;);\r\n}\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>Check out the blog for more details, but here are the key features I enjoy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Out variables are terrible.<\/strong> Anything that lets me use less of them is a good thing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Custom return types are boilerplate.<\/strong> Removing ceremony while retaining type safety is amazing.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nTuples with unnamed item members are never self documenting code. <\/strong> I&#8217;m tired of having to go back to the calling code to clarify if it was the first int or the second that was my ID.<\/p>\n<p>These factors together make Tuples the changes I looking forward to most when my legacy code base in updated.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s your favorite feature of C# 7.0?

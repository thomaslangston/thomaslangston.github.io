Especially if management is willing to spend the time to bring both new and old developers up to speed, and either move to new JS libraries as they become dominant or to support legacy frameworks on their own. If these are true, and problem set supports the case of offloading work to the client, significant performance gains can be realized.<\/p>\n<p>MVC however is not dead.

It is reasonable to believe they may also mature, standardizing around stable major frameworks and practices. However the decreasing costs of web server HTML rendering, is going to continue keeping MVC a good choice for applications with limited numbers of users, limited development budgets, or SEO concerns.<\/p>\n<p>Developers of MVC applications should familiarize themselves with SPA best practices, cherry picking use cases for their applications to transfer techniques.
